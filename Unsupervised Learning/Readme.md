# Image Compression
Image data always needs to be compressed due to the storage limit, and several clustering algorithms are commonly used to compress the image. In this project, we applied four algorithms, K-Means, Winner-take-all, SOM Map and Mean Shift, to cluster the image, and compressed the image data by converting true color image to indexed color image. From the results, we found that, for K-Means, Winner-take-all, SOM Map, the optimal number of clusters is the same and is 16, the Winner	-take-all has a slight better cluster result. For Mean Shift, the optimal number of clusters is provided automatically, and the cluster result is better than the other three algorithms.
